# Introduction


The script run_analysis.Rperforms the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.

* First, all the similar data is merged using the rbind() and cbind() functions.  
* Then, the columns get renamed using the feature.txt file, and only the columns with std deviation and mean get extracted from the data set.  
* As activity data is addressed with values 1:6, we take the activity names and IDs from act_labels.txt and they are substituted in the dataset.  
* On the whole dataset, those columns with vague column names are corrected.  
* Finally, we generate a new dataset with all the average measures for each subject and activity type. The output file is called Cleaning_project.txt, and uploaded to this repository. 


# Variables

* **x_train**, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
