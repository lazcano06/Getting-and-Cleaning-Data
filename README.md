# Getting and Cleanning Data Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit:  
1. a tidy data set as described below  
2. a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis  
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.   
4. You should also include a README file in the repo with your scripts,
This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
