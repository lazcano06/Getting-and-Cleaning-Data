# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones]   (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) 


## Files

The code starts by downloading and creating the folder if it doesn't exist, if it does takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

> **Codebook.Rmd** <
describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

**run_analisys** contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called **Cleaning_project.txt**, and uploaded in the course project's form.
